- 👋 Hi, I’m @GihPiffer
- 👀 I am interested in learning front-end languages.
- 🌱 I am currently learning HTML and CSS.

I started my IT career in 2008 working in person.<br>
Since 2017 I work remotely, by phone, e-mail, with a remote access tool, solving incidents with troubleshooting and working on requests.<br>
Currently I discovered my true passion in the front-end development area, where I intend to continue learning more and more.
